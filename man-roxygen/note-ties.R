#' @note
#' This regression may give odd results when the outcomes are tied,
#' imposing an arbitrary order on the tied outcomes.
#' Moreover, no warning may be issued in this case.
#' In future releases, ties may be dealt with differently,
#' perhaps in analogy to how ties are treated in the
#' Cox Proportional Hazards regression, using
#' the methods of Breslow or Efron.
